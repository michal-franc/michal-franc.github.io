We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.

```

We are in 2026 and I am not 100% sure were we are headed as a industry (software engineering) when it comes to AI and LLMs but in order to prepare for the future I have some thoughts and `bets`. 

By `bets` I mean. As staff+ engineer I need to have an opinion and strategy on how to evolve the organisation I lead. Of course this is just an `opinion` based on my current knowledge, everything can change with time - we will see (**it is important to be adaptable**).

So here it is my current view for 2026 when it coems to AI/LLMs, IT and software engineering.

```ad-note
_TL;DR;_
- There are 3 AI camps - we are `doomed`, AI will `fail`, AI will `transform` the market
- I'm in the transformation camp
- The core of software engineering was always - impact and value generation
- Transformation towards Product engineering and Systems Thinking
- Transformation is nothing new in IT It will be a source of opportunities
- Being early adopter of technology or paradigm shift == big profits
- What it means for junior engineers? mid engineers? senior engineers? staff+ engineers?
```
## There are 3 AI camps

**Doomers**
In this scenario, I'm assuming we reach AGI and AI simply replaces us. But looking at recent evaluations, like [METR's assessment of OpenAI's GPT-5.1-Codex-Max](https://evaluations.metr.org/gpt-5-1-codex-max-report/#summary), current LLM systems are still incapable of generating serious problems for us. And if we look at benchmarks like [ARC Prize](https://arcprize.org/), we're still far, far away from reaching AGI, at least based on the way we currently mesure what AGI is. Based on [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/) there is also a scenario that we have paradise enabled by AI, but it also implies that the industry as a whole is `gone`.

**AI is a fad**
In the past there were two major [AI winters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter). It is possible that another one is just around the corner.  There are alrready experts that argue that LLMs are not AI and are going to take us nowwhere. That the path to AGI requires more breakthroughs. I can't argue with that as I am not an expert in this field all I am interested is on how to use the current generation of AI/LLMs in my field of expertise.

I think we're long past the point where we can assyne that AI is a failure. Based on my experience and people around me there is a lot of utility and value in the current generation of LLMs. I don't think anyone will argue about that. The discussions in my circle are more about - how to use it? What are the good  practices? What will be the new design patterns we should adapt to?

Also based on the [Can AI scaling continue through 2030?](https://epoch.ai/blog/can-ai-scaling-continue-through-2030) it looks like that we will be able to scale AI training runs to 2030. At the moment it looks like there is no major bottleneck apart from "AI is a bubble" burst - which might slow things down. But the "AI bubble" is just a course correction and is more about hype and investmenet promises made to investors not about the usefullness of this technology.

**Transformation**
So when the bubble pops and the dust settles - what will the market look like? I believe AI tools will become just that: _tools_, and the question is how will this transformation look like.

```ad-sidenote
_AI usefullness polarization_

The AI usefulness debate has two teams: "it's broken" and "engineers are dead." Both are wrong. AI is great at some problems, terrible at others. The interesting question is knowing which is which.

## Transformation - nothing new in IT

<div markdown="0">
{% include /ai-future/chart-demand.html %}
</div>

This is of course obvious, but the market is _constantly changing_. If you look at the overall employment history of Tech related roles in the US, you see roughly a steady growth. I couldn't find exact data for software engineers, but these roles did follow a similar curve.

Based on this chart we can assume here that demand is growing constantly. But this view hides a lof of complexity. Definining what "software engineering" role is, is simple when we think about generic terms like - building software. But uderneath when we think about programming languages, specfifics skills or practices used in this field - the view gets a lot more complicated.

What the market actually demands shifts constantly - different skills, different eras, different value.

### Programming Languages
<div markdown="0">
{% include /ai-future/chart-languages.html %}
</div>

This shift can be observed in programming language popularity. The [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) shows how languages rise and fall over time. The industry was once dominated by Java, C, and C++. Now Python sits at the top - likely driven by demand in data science and AI.

The growing demand is spread across different programming languages needs based on market needs.

**My personal experience:** The first language I have used commercially at work - was JavaScript with JQuery (old times). Then I moved to C# / .NET world for couple of years.  There was some time with more of Javascript (Angular/Reac), and I moved to write software in Golang, Java, Python or even Lua. These days I mostly write code in C#, Golang, Python.

```ad-sidenote
_Tiobe index vs PYPL index_

I know Tiobe is only one way opinionated way to measure programming language usage. Other approaches like [PYPL](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) sometimes show different data. But both tell the same story: language popularity is fluid. What dominates today won't necessarily dominate tomorrow.
```

### Emerging Skills 
<div markdown="0">
{% include /ai-future/chart-emerging-skills.html %}
</div>

Similar picture does come up in the skills area - from Manual QA to Test Automation, Devops, DevSecOps. A lot of the current demand requires new types of skills that we had to acquire over time.

**My personal experience:** I have started as Sharepoint Developer long time ago, then I jumped into fullstack ASP.NET world. I was a huge advocate of TDD. As the industry changed I was an early adopter of docker and cloud. Even thought i spent a lot of time in C# oriented companies - I have never used Azure but AWS. With time I discovered beatifull world of distributed systems and I focused more on DevOps/SRE oriented work. Today I would consider myself to be a generalist.

### Methodologies
<div markdown="0">
{% include /ai-future/chart-metodologies.html %}
</div>

And last chart methodologies - once we were dominated by waterfall which then change to agile and scrum.

**My personal experience:** I had opportunity to try Waterfall (It wasn't as bat as the current myths portray it). But I entered market with already big ideas like DDD, Agile on the horizon so it was easy to switch over to it.

## Why does transformation happen? Competition → Commoditisation → Innovation
Transformation isn't unique to tech. It's core part of our economic model and arguably part of being human. We evolved in a competitive environment, under constant pressure from natural selection. That same pressure drove us toward collaboration, cooperation, and eventually organising ourselves into societies.  In the market we are in a constant cycle of: **Competition -> Commoditization -> Innovation**

Here is what I mean: A company discovers a new need in the market, creates a product, this brings profit. Other companies see it and start competing. Competition drives down margins, and the product becomes commoditised - meaning it is not special anymore. To escape low margins, you need to innovate. Find novel ideas to create new value. And the cycle repeats.

```ad-sidenote
_What about `monopolies`?_
I know, I know - this is much more complicated and competition is not as clear. There are specific markets dominated by single companies (either whole segment of the market or geographically), and even in the past goverments had to interveene in order to open up the competition as Big players always have an incentive to control competition and the market itself.

One great example from my country was breaking up dominant telecomunications company in Poland to open up the market (which was very succesfull for the economy and the consumers).

But as a principle - competition as one of the main market drivers in general still holds.
```
### Software development was always under transformation pressure
Now, as software engineers, we might think this doesn't apply to us. We are engineers and all of the transformations were driven by innovation and people wanting to do things better. Some of it, sure. Open source is a perfect example of people building better tools because they wanted better tools. But a lot of innovation, was driven by the market.

**Software development process has always been expensive and was considered to be a pain point to get around.** Designing systems, writing code, testing, releasing to production - all of it costs time and money while the specifics of building software was never the _point_. The goal was always to build a product. Software development was a necessary cost to get there.

The market - companies, individual engineers, entire communities - felt pressure or need to innovate to bring the cost of development down. Make the work easier:
- New programming languages made it easier to write code
- Frameworks like the JVM handled memory management so we didn't have to
- Languages like Go and Erlang targeted concurrency as systems grew more complex
- Ruby and Python optimised for productivity and speed of delivery
- Agile innovated around the SDLC process
- Cloud made it simpler to orchestrate complex architectures without owning hardware
- DevOps emerged to bring engineers closer to infrastructure - but only after the cost of both coding and infrastructure engineering dropped enough, and complexity increased enough, to make it worthwhile
 
This was a difficult truth for me to accept. As an engineer, I wanted to believe the craft itself mattered. It took me a time to realise that the market doesn't care about Software Craftmanship or how elegant the code is. Of course this doesn't mean that we can just YOLO with software development but there is a term I like to use called **Good Enough Software** that puts a lot more pressure on Engineering Talent to decide how to develop software in a scalable, maintanable, sustainable way - depending on the context - market, product and organisation you are in.

###  The case of Cloud, Kubernetes - abstracting away complexity
What also emerges from these transformation is that each wave abstracts away complexity and shifts where value is created.

Cloud, and Kubernetes are a good example here. Initially, only the biggest companies could build truly scalable, global products. They had the resources, expertise and infrastructure to do it. But as internet usage grew, more companies wanted the same capabilities. AWS capitalised on this - opening up their way to do it in the form of cloud. But the complexity of these systems kept growing. It still wasn't easy to make them reliable and scalable. So the market responded again: orchestration systems emerged to manage the chaos. And then we got Kubernetes.

I know - Kubernetes is complex. It's not "easy." It's sometimes overused. But here's what it did: it commoditised the ability to build global, scalable, reliable systems. What was once the domain of really Big Companies became accessible to a much broader market. **This shifted where the hard problems lived - and where the value was created.**

This also commoditised the skills needed to build global systems. But the demand was there, so it created opportunity. If you were willing to learn, you could capitalise on the shift. The market rewarded those who adapted. This change also actually opened up the need for new type of skills to a wider market.

### The case of Manual -> Automated -> AI driven testing

<div markdown="0">
{% include /ai-future/chart-testing-transition.html %}
</div>

**Manual QA**  - Steady decline demand is dropping, skill becomes oversupplied. Red zone - too many people, not enough roles. The market stopped rewarding this skill.

**Test Automation** - Different story, steady increase in demand, supply lagging behind. Green zone - shortage, high value, opportunity. People who learned automation early rode that wave. 

**AI Testing** - is the new emerging skill. Right now: high demand, low supply. Another Green zone. Another window of opportunity. Higher impact on Manual QA as AI agent testing will target this area heavilly.

The pattern repeats:
1. New skill emerges → undersupplied → high value
2. People learn new skills → supply grows → value normalises
3. Next shift arrives → previous skills lose steam

## Transformation creates a window of opportunity

Every paradigm shift follows a pattern. Early adopters get in, figure out the new tools, and unlock productivity gains before everyone else. That head start translates to outsized value on the market.

But this boost doesn't last. As adoption spreads, best practices develop, tooling matures, and what was once an edge becomes the baseline. The window closes. What felt like a superpower becomes just "how things are done."

We're in that window right now.

The market has always rewarded people who invest early and take risk. Not reckless risk—calculated bets on where things are heading. The engineers who leaned into cloud early, who adopted DevOps before it was a job title, who bet on mobile when it was still "nice to have"—they rode the wave up.

I believe AI will transform our industry. It will make us more productive, more impactful, and ultimately more rewarded by the businesses we work for. But to benefit from this shift, you'll need to transform yourself. You'll need to become a different type of engineer.

AI is and will be an opportunity for the whole industry. But there will be people who benefit from it and people who won't. I'm not saying jobs will disappear—I don't think that's the case. What _will_ shift is the value of different roles and the types of skills you bring. Some skills will appreciate. Some will depreciate. The question is which side you're on.
 
```ad-note
_IT is in a pole position_

Being in tech means you're in pole position to see what's coming. We're one of the first industries adopting AI at scale. That puts us in the early adopter bracket of a technology shift that will eventually hit every industry. A lot of sectors will face this challenge in 5–10 years. By then, we'll have already lived through it and experienced it, which will open doors to many places not only related to Tech/IT.
