<p>While studying I was doing a lot of different projects. One of them was a simple simulation of bird flock movements. This will be a series of posts about changes in this project. It will contain a lot of code reviews and development information's.</p>
<p>Project is hosted on <strong>GitHub</strong> if you want to follow the code and changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/LaMik/SilverlightBoids">https://github.com/LaMik/SilverlightBoids</a></p>
<p>I use <a href="https://trello.com/"><strong>Trello</strong></a><strong> </strong>to manage ideas, tasks, bug fixes  etc.</p>
<h4>Project Overview</h4>
<p>This app is simulating movement of bird flocks. Each object that is representing single bird is called <strong>BOID. </strong>Each of them can perform various actions which are influencing behavior and in the end vector, that is responsible for the movement in the next iteration.</p>
<p>More complex description of the algorithms involved in this project.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Boid</strong> is rendered as a simple pixel. There are options like</p>
<ul>
<li>Add new boid</li>
<li>Add Random boid</li>
<li>Options for different behavious</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very simple</p>
<h5>Simulation</h5>
<p>Each Iteration of the simulation world is divided into these actions</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/image5.png"><img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px; border: 0px;" title="image" src="assets/image_thumb5.png" alt="image" width="534" height="148" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>For each <strong>Boid </strong>we perform <strong>Do Actions </strong>function which iterates through <strong>Action </strong>list and create a <strong>Vector </strong>class that is describing current movement and position change of the<strong> Boid. </strong>After caluclation we perform position change and <strong>Rerender</strong> of world. This is just a simple explanation of engine.</p>
<h4>Future Changes</h4>
<p>I want to move core logic to separated project because in the future I want to separate and support presentation layer in form of html 5 and canvas. I want to use <strong>.Net</strong> to calculate complex calculations and web service as a transport layer to the canvas rendering in the browser. I will see how it works and if there will be any performance issues then I will think about moving algorithms calculations to the javascript.</p>
<p>I also have to think about nice and easy <strong>Gui</strong>.</p>
<h4>Future Features</h4>
<p>I want to support couple of nice features in future releases</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to modify\ behavioral algorithms</li>
<li>Simple Game based on the engine</li>
<li>Html 5 Canvas rendering + web service communication</li>
<li>Storing state either on <strong>Redis</strong> or <strong>MsSql</strong> with <strong>NHibernate</strong> layer</li>
</ul>
