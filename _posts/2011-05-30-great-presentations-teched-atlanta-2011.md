I have spent some time on the weekend watching Tech Ed on channel 9

1. <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DEV333">Hack Proofing Your Microsoft ASP.NET Web Forms and MVC Applications</a>

- Sql Injections

- Cross Site Scripting

- parameter tampering in MVC3

Great presentation with ton of useful information's . I didn’t knew that you can exploit web applications in soo many ways.

<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DPR201">2. The Architect</a>

- Software Development Crisis

- Great analogies to other engineering disciplines

If you don’t want to end as a Code Monkey in the near future. You have to watch this presentation.

3 . <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2011/DEV320">Demystifying Debugging with Microsoft Visual Studio Ultimate and IntelliTrace</a>

- lots of good stuff about debugging features in VS

- IntelliTrace and VS Tests

Now I know that this window on the left side of the screen is called IntelliTrace and it’s a great tool ;]
