Series QA - on JS, React and ASP.NET MVC

I do spend a lot of time discussing different things. People ask me questions etc. Some of them are really great and I will start posting them on the blog. Not yet sure if its gonna be, weekly, monthly, yearly.

1. Is react making ASP.NET MVC obsolete ?

I know what you are thinking. You go to some RSS, blog and React or Angular2 is there, you might even notice Aurelia.  Hype is huge!

Same thing happened some time ago when RoR was launched. There was a huge hype and I was also afraid that maybe RoR will make my WebForms knowledge obsolete. What RoR did however is it caused WebForms evolution to ASP.NET MVC. Instead of killing technology, hyping technology has helped the other one :) Same thing is happening right now with ASP.NET Core.

ASP.NET MVC is an apple when react is an orange. You can mix both react and ASP.NET MVC in one app. The later framework might start losing some ground. Learning react will be beneficial to your career if you want to specialize in web development. With react-native there is also a chance that this knowledge could be useful in mobile world. There is Angular2 with Typescript, this mix would be more friendly to start with as TS is kind of static typed. Feels similar to C# oriented world. 

The answer is no it won't make it obsolete but in my opinion ASP.NET MVC will be loosing adoption. We still have to wait for new ASP.NET Core to see where it goes and how good it is. I preditct a separation of frontend and backed, in the near future. Razor generated Views with backend are gonna be replaced by templates on Client side with API calls to backend.

2. Should i start using JS in my .NET projects ?

Assuming that we are talking here about hobby projects then yes. Even if you want to be backend dev it is good to know a bit about frontend. Bear in mind that react, angular etc. are not really a good place to start. For WEB try to apply some JQuery or other less complicated 'frameworks'.

In learning JS try <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a>, <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a>. Read classic books like <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742">"JS The good Parts"</a>. After some practice and learning more advanced topics can be found here <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">You Don't Know JS</a>.

Javascript is slowly eating the world. There is enormous hype. A lot of innovation happens on the client side and with node it slowly invades backend too. It would be a mistake to ignore this piece of IT world for a web dev. To be more involved I recently moved to Mac machine and mostly write react code in VIM. A huge step for .NET backend developer like me.

Javascript might feel a bit weird, clunky and sometimes not properly polished. ES6 changes this a lot and shows a signs of a very mature interesting language. The notion that Javascript is mostly about some hacked scripts is slowly ending. JS community embraces proper Software practices and approaches. This is a necessity as web dev apps become more and more complicated.

3. I got the impression that backend feels less important and frontend is taking over. I do notice mostly frontend developers job offers. Should i focus on .NET to find nice interesting projects / companies ? .NET still feels more corporate I don't want to end up in corporation ?

IT market is Huge. The job offers you see are the ones that you want to see. Some specialities, frameworks, languages might be more popular but there is still a huge demands for programmers of all kinds. It also depends how wide is your search range. IT is different in each country, city, region. In Silicon Valley I noticed a lot of Reliability Engineers ads, in Poland there are a plenty of Frontend jobs ads. It doesn't mean that there are no other jobs available. Widen your search range, find new 'channels' of job opportunities.

Maybe you live in an area with small IT market, it might be time to move on and change place to the are that does need your skillset. Remote working becomes more and more popular, maybe thath is an option.

After some years and further specialisation you will create a network of connections and places to look for work. Your own personal bubble with the job offers you are interested in. Keep in mind that with more experience and knowledge the pool of interesting job offers is decreasing and decreasing. That is why you need to build a reliable network of people and companies to be aware of jobs that are intersting to you. Ideally it is good to create a personal brand, but it's quite difficult to achieve that :)

The same thing applies to interesting projects, companies. Bigger network, personal brand is very helpfull in finding those. Good companies and interesting projects are rare and those job offers are not available publicly. You will also be competing with other good developers looking for such a places. That is why you need the network and ideally a brand. I wouldn't link tehcnology to how interesting the companie is. Tech is just Tech. I aggree some obscure new technologies might be used by more interesting companies projects and that is a kind of way to find them. BUt it is not really reliable way to do this.

Sometimes you might get lucky just like me when I found position in awesome company JustGiving. But were I really lucky or maybe visible thanks to my work in community, blog, twitter etc. This Exposure might have increased my 'luck', and one example of connections. @pawelsawicz is making huge steps in his career working for great companies with interesting projects beacuse I knew him and when tere was a hidden 'job opportunity' in JG I recommended him ...
