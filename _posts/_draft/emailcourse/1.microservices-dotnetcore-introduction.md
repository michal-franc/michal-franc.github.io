Welcome to the first lesson.

Today we will start exploring the world of Microservices, and the best place to start is to talk about current hype and the rise and fall of Service Oriented Architecture.

#### Microservices Hype

// Tech Adoption image - Hype cycle

Hype is real. Like with every new tech trend. It follows the same pattern - [Hype Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle).

It is driven by:

* early adopters - people who love to experiment and try new things
* consultants -  looking for new tech/ideas to learn and sell
* tooling companies - beting on new trend, building tools to fulfill future demand
* product companies - hoping on getting the competetive edge thanks to new tech
* many more

Every tech big or small had similar groups of supporters/adopters.

With Microservice, we are on the left side of the first peek. Expectations are high, tooling is missing. All of this is still waiting to be established by people like you and me. In order to do that early adopters need to share their experience. By starting the journey early you can take part in it and establish yourself as an expert. There was never a better time to start this journey.

#### Cloud + Big Data == Huge Hype Train

Why there is such a hype? 

Two potential reasons:

* Cloud
* Big Data

Cloud Computing on its own was a hype some time ago. Since then it has entrenched its position. From humble begginings we are now slowly hitting 'Plateu of Productivity'. There are establised tools and a lot of knowledge shared around. Smaller hype cycles like serverless are also happening. On its own this move is generating a wave of changes. Cloud is an enabler. It is slowly decreasing the cost of infrastracture. This frees up resources for new opportunities anc innovation.

Then enters Big Data with its marvelous promise of being the next big thing. Companies gather a lot of data and ... don't know what to do with it. Machine learning and deep learning, to the rescue. This field is still at the beggining with huge hype and expcetations. We will se what will happen in the coming years.

All of this, puts a huge demand for building scalable and highly available products. We had the first glimpse of something like that with SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) but it was mostly in the enterprise sector. Microservices are the incremental evolution. A new paradigm shift, in the way we think about software architecture.

#### What happened to SOA?

You won't be surprised when I will tell you that SOA some time ago seen a similar hype. Knowing a bit of its history will be usefull to understand Microservices context. Lot of ideas came first with SOA. I think that soa was like a first wave of democratizing Distributed Systems. Microservices are a 2nd one.

*Some SOA Context*

In the book "SOA in Practice", I have found information that SOA term was coined by Alexander Pasik (analyst at Gartner). This was before XML and WebServices. He created this term to distinguish new approach that was different than simple client/server that lost "its classical meaning". With SOA Pasik wanted to stress out that server side should be considered as more distributed with multiple servers (services) instead of one big monolithic server side app.

In 2000 Microsoft created WebServices and this has made the hype and expectation growing really high. It was WebServices that were supposed to bring SOA to the mainstream. It was a framework that was symplyifing a lot of work and establishing certain patterns to increase productivity.

Lot of Analysts and Companies started preaching SOA as the future of the Software Development and more vendors get on the hype train (IBM, Oracle, HP, SAP, SUN). Everyone wanted to monetize the hype.

"There was money to be made by explaining idea, and by selling new concepts and tools (or rebranded concept and tools)... the time was right ... companies were increasingly seeking to integrate their businesses"

*What was SOA?*

Quickly.

It was an answer to complex integrations. There was a huge hype called 'B2B hype'. SOA was supposed to bring flexibility and reuse to business and enable quicker time to market by providing ability to quickly link different departments/products. It also was supposed to provide exposure of systems to external World. Back then API's were non existient.

Soa was based on three principles:
* create services - that provide a single business capability
* loose coupling - as everything is a service you can decouple your projects more easilly
* ESB - enterprise service bus - piece of infrastracture that services talk to in order to comunicate with each other

*What happened to SOA?*

Nothing? Ok let me explain it. 

Biggest hype on SOA was around 2007. Try and compare both SOA and Microservices in Google Trends. You will notice that new hype is not even close to the level of SOA.  Even if the hype is now down and SOA was pronounced dead in 2009. Core principles of are still with us - orientation on services, reuse, registry, lose coupling . Microservices are just a incremental improvement of the old idea. 

As a marketing term SOA has died. But as a technological shift in the enginerering mindset it has layed a foundation for todays world and revolutions.

Originaly Software Oriented Architecture was not ready for adoption. It was mostly adopted by Waterfall Enterprise companies that tried to change the world with revolution instead of slowly evolving their systems. Revolution ment too much time spent, planning, preparing and building something without verification. Many companies build too complicated architectures and systems that didnt have any value, but needed maintnance. This cost halted progress and blocked a lot of competetive edge.

SOA as a marketing term was also hijacked by software vendros that sold 'bad' practices. Some companies didn't even need SOA to achieve their goals but due to big vendors, marketing and hype they have started the 'transformation' without even checking if they need it.

#### Important

Based on SOA and current hype, we need to be carefull. It is not like Microservices are the silver bullet. This approach is only a tool bo solve a problem. Monolith is still viable option for many projects.

Also remember the first rule of distributed systems:

> The first rule of distributed systems is donâ€™t distribute your system until you have an observable reason to
