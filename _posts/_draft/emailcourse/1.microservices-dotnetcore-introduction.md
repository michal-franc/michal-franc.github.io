Welcome to the first lesson.

Today we will start exploring the world of Microservices. To start the journey we need to discuss hype and SOA.

#### Microservices Hype

Like with every new tech trend. It follows the same pattern - [Hype Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle).

Driven by:

* early adopters - people who love to experiment and try new things
* consultants -  looking for new tech/ideas to learn and sell
* tooling companies - betting on new trend, building tools to fulfil future demand
* product companies - hoping on getting the competitive edge thanks to new tech
* much more

Every tech big or small had similar groups of supporters/adopters.

If you look at the Hype Cycle image. The Huge hype on Microservices. Caused many companies, to adopt them in non-optimal scenarios. This is causing a drop in interest and people are getting off the 'silver bullet' train. It enters moment when we have tooling and knowledge available to promote this approach in 'good scenarios'. Tooling increases the chance of 'good' adoption thus causing expectation to rise again. There is still a lot of places, for you and me, to help build tools and share knowledge. To do those early adopters need to share their experience. By starting the journey now you can establish yourself as an expert. There was never a better time to start learning about Microservices and distributed computing.

#### Cloud + Big Data == Huge Hype Train

Why there is such a hype? 

Two reasons:

* Cloud
* Big Data

Cloud Computing was a hype on its own. It has entrenched its position now. It is well into 'Plateau of Productivity'. There are tools, knowledge and experience shared around. Smaller hype cycles like server-less are also happening. On its own, this move is generating a wave of changes. Cloud is a 'tech' and innovation enabler. By decreasing the cost of infrastructure and automation of certain processes, it frees up resources for new opportunities and innovation.

Then enters Big Data with its marvellous promise of being the next big thing. Companies gather a lot of data and ... don't know what to do with it. Machine learning and deep learning, to the rescue. This field is still at the beginning with huge hype and expectations. Keep an eye on it too.

Big Data and Cloud opens doors to a new level of product complexity. This generates pressure to innovate and stay competitive on the market. We need to contain complexity. The monolithic approach might not be good enough in many scenarios.   

This opens a window for new types of architectures or 'old' ones that were no ready for prime time - SOA. Service Oriented Architecture was the beginning of a revolution. Some might say it is dead but after a lot of research,  I say SOA is alive.

#### What happened to SOA?

No surprises here, SOA was also one of those 'silver bullet', 'over-hyped' ideas. Lots of ideas and principles that we take for granted now came first with SOA. It was a first wave of democratising Distributed Systems and external 'API'. Microservices are the 2nd one.

**Context**

In the book "SOA in Practice". There is an information that the term was coined by Alexander Pasik (analyst at Gartner). This was before XML and WebServices. He created it to distinguish between a new approach to creating systems. Pasik wanted to point out that server side should be more distributed. This was a different way of thinking compared to the usual monolithic approach.

In 2000 Microsoft created WebServices and this has made the hype high. WebServices could bring SOA to the mainstream. This framework was simplifying a lot of work by conventions and patterns. This usually brings a lot of productivity gain with a cost of limiting certain options.

Analysts and Companies started preaching SOA as the future of the Software Development. More vendors got on the hype train (IBM, Oracle, HP, SAP, SUN). Everyone wanted to monetize on it.

"There was money to be made by explaining an idea, and by selling new concepts and tools (or rebranded concept and tools)... the time was right ... companies were increasingly seeking to integrate their businesses"

**What was SOA?**

It was an answer to increasing complexity in the enterprise systems. It was supposed to bring the marvel of integrations and bring all the enterprise departments together. There was a huge hype called 'B2B hype'.  That was all about bringing flexibility and reuse to business. It also promised, quicker time to market and ability to link different departments. It also mentioned exposure to external World. Back then API-first approach was not existent. The idea to build external API was a novelty.

There were three principles:
* create services - that provide a single business capability
* loose coupling - as everything is a service you can decouple your projects
* ESB - Enterprise service bus - infrastructure providing communication layer for services

**What happened to SOA?**

Nothing? Let me explain it. 

The biggest hype on SOA was around 2007. Try and compare both SOA and Microservices in Google Trends. You will notice that new hype is not even close to the level of SOA.  Even if the hype is now down and SOA considered dead as of 2009. It has left the mark. Core principles are still here.

* orientation on services
* reuse
* service registry
* lose coupling 

Microservices are an incremental improvement of those old ideas. 

As a marketing term, SOA has died. But as a technological mindset shift, it is still here.

Original Software Oriented Architecture was not ready for adoption. Waterfall Enterprise companies used it. Tried to change their systems with revolution instead of evolution. It ended with a lot of time spent, planning, preparing and building something that was not verified. Complicated architectures and systems were built, with small value but high maintenance. This cost halted progress and burned a lot of competitive edges.

SOA as a marketing term was also hijacked by software vendors that sold 'not suitable' practices. Some companies didn't need SOA to achieve their goals but due to big vendors, marketing and hype. Started the 'transformation' without checking if there is a need for it. It is happening with all the hypes.

#### Where does Microservice fit in this?

For me, Microservices are the product of a new generation of engineers. SOA always felt like more corporate, rigid, standardised way of building Software. It might be an overstatement, but when I think about SOA. I see a big corporation with complex systems and complicated architecture.

Microservices are like new cool kids on the block, full of energy and passion. Driven by Lean, Agile, XP. At the moment there is a tendency to ignore black clouds on the horizons and risk associated with a new way of life. More experienced engineers, that do remember SOA times, have a lot of experience to share. But do we want to listen? 

I don't want to sound too pessimistic but we shouldn't erase SOA completely from our memory. Microservices are not better, nicer, this is an evolution. Without SOA baseline there wouldn't be any evolution possible. There is a tonne of books, resources and experience laying around from the 'old' days. It will be useful for the new world of distributed microservices. It would be a waste to discard the past.

One of the problems of the current state is: No one knows what Microservice is. There is no formal definition, no standard. Back in the old days, there were usually some wise people. Meeting together formulating RFC's to define common ground. It's not like this was a perfect solution as a lot of 'standardisation' was more about monetization of ideas under consultancy movements instead of working for greater good. At the moment no one bothered to do that. Or they tried but it was not good enough to reach more people.

There is a demand for a shift to more distributed architectures. Some companies already achieved that long time ago. Amazon was always service oriented with teams owning their own services. Another example is Netflix, but those are special snowflake with huge scale and needs. Don't fall into a trap thinking that Netflix is the beacon of all the great ideas that you have to follow. Assess your context, explore your domain, look for a solution and adapt. 

Distributed world is not going away. We won't be able to hide it forever behind frameworks and tools. IOT, Cloud, BigData, Mesh infrastructure, that is the future. 

I started with micro-controller programming, moved on to the desktop, then to the web, now it is time to start embracing distributed systems. It will be worth it.

#### Important

Remember the first rule of distributed systems:

> The first rule of distributed systems is donâ€™t distribute your system until you have an observable reason to

Distributed Systems are important, and they will gain more exposure, but they are not a silver bullet.

This is important. Distributed systems are not silver bullets.
