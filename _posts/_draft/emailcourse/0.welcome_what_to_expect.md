Congratulations for singing up to this course! You are gonna love it!

#### What to expect?

X lessons in your email box full of practical knowledge about starting up with the microservices using .NET Core, Docker.

We will go together through:

* Introduction to Microservices
* Your first .NET core based Microservice
* Adding Docker to the mix
* Building simple distributed system
* Deploying to the Cloud

#### Do I need to prepare anything?

Prepare a cozy nice room, some free time and probably a coffee (I love the black one without the sugar). To be honest you don't need to prepare anything apart from some developer machine to write and compile code. Last lesson requires Azure account with some credits to start up boxes.

Otherwise all the tools presented here are free. Most of the stuff will be done from command line. Don't worry if that is not your 'comfort' zone. You will be fine. Actually that course might also be a great introduction to CLI, a powerful tool in the toolbelt of every developer.

#### Where is the catch? Why this course is for free?

I need your help. I am doing this to:

* learn, as a person creating course I am also learning on how to structure knowledge and present it in best way
* get feedback from you, and this is really the most important aspect here, I need your feedback, at the end of the course there will be an email with the poll
* I want to establish a relationship with you. Who knows maybe one day we might do some business together?
