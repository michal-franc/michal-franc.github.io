Thank you for singing up. Trust me, you are gonna love it!

#### What to expect?

X lessons in your email box full of practical and some theoretical knowledge. I want to share with you my experience of building cloud first distributed products. In the past 5 years, I have built different products that required scale. I also made a migration to the cloud. There is plenty to share.

#### We will go together through

* Introduction to Microservices
* Your first .NET core based Microservice
* Adding Docker to the mix
* Building simple distributed system

In the future, I will add more:
* How to build scalable solutions?
* How to design Twitter and run it live?
* CQRS - based system
* CAP Theorem
* Weak vs Strong Consistency

More and more and more. I am waiting for your feedback.

#### Do I need to prepare anything?

Prepare a cosy nice room, some free time and a coffee (I love the black one without sugar). To be honest you don't need to prepare anything apart from dev machine. It's not like we are gonna code on paper.

All the tools presented here are free. There is a lot of command line. Don't worry if that is not your 'comfort' zone. You will be fine. This could be a great time embrace CLI world. Is is a powerful tool.

#### Where is the catch? Why this course is free?

I need your help. I am doing this to:

* learn, how to create online courses.
* get feedback from you - this is super important. 
* I want to establish a relationship with you.

#### Course structure and timeline

* One email per day
* 60 min investment - per lesson

Next email tomorrow. Have fun :)
