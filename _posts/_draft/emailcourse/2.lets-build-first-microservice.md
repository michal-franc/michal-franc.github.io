The last lesson was all about theory. Time to do something more practical. Code!

In this lesson, we will answer the most important question - What is a Microservice? We will also build one. There is a healthy mix of theory and practice.

I do encourage you to use the console as much as possible. All the examples are being done and tested by me on a machine running 'Linux Mint with i3wm'. If you want to check my setup - [dotfiles link here][11]

.NET Core has a good SDK that enables us to work from the terminal. Microsoft also replaced templating engine with their own solution. They used yeoman. It wasn't bad, not sure why they have reinvented the wheel but the new generator is quite good.

You need .NET core installed on your machine, [instruction on how to install dotnet CLI and SDK here.][9]

#### Linux User / Mac User

All you need to progress is an installation of .NET SDK and your editor of choice. Nothing else. There will be Docker included in later episodes so running docker daemon and Docker CLI is also needed.

### Windows User 

Default cmd.exe in Windows is ok but it is not great. If you want to follow this course using console do yourself a favour and install a better tool. 

* [cmder (my choice)][3]
* [ConEmu][4]

To be fair cmder is also a ConEmu as it is an extension. 

The best option for Windows is Windows 10 PRO with Hypervisor enabled. This provides a very easy to use Docker environment. If you don't have Win 10 PRO you can use boot2docker solution that uses VitualBox. This approach is a bit more 'clunky' but is should be enough.

#### IDE

I am using Visual Studio Code - but you can use whatever editor you like. I wanted to make some magic happen with Vim. Unfortunately .NET support through Omnisharp is not there yet on Linux Mint. Of course, you can also use Visual Studio. Feel free to use whatever you want. Word of advice. We will use Nuget. You need to have some IDE with the support or a way to install NuGet packages from the CLI.

#### Lets start coding

We will start with the basic console app.

.NET SDK provide a generator. In the past Microsoft used Yeoman. Now there is a custom build tool, that works the same as Yeoman.

Run in a console.

```
dotnet new
```

You should get some information back with a list of available templates. There are some available by default. You can extend those and add your own. As a matter of fact later in the course, we will use the template created by me. If you are curious - [here is the link that explains the process.][10].

Create a new folder somewhere to hold all the code for this course.

```
mkdir distributed-systems-course
cd distributed-systems-course
```

For this basic test, we will run

```
mkdir distributed-systems-course
cd distributed-systems-course
dotnet new console -n micro-console -o micro-console
```
This will generate a basic console application with a name 'micro-console' in a folder 'micro-console'

This app displays 'Hello World'. 

Using SDK we can restore all the NuGet packages, build and run the app.

```
cd micro-console
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotner run
```

Boom Hello world!

#### Hello World Microservice using Asp.net Core

Time for something more complicated. Go back to the main folder.

```
dotnet new web API -n micro-web -o micro-web
```

This generates a  simple web API app.

Once again, you know what to do.

```
dotnet restore
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

When you hit the localhost:5000 you should get a response from Kestrel server.

```
-> http lcalhost:5000

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Length: 0
Date: Thu, 15 Jun 2017 21:28:27 GMT
Server: Kestrel
```
PS: Important note here. I am using httpie to run the HTTP request from the console. For me, it is a bit better than curl. Feel free to check endpoints whatever methods suit you. It can be curls or another tool, or even browser.

This means that the app is running fine. Kestrel is a lightweight dotnet core server useful for development. For production, I would recommend using Nginx. We will do this in future episodes.

To see some response hit

```
-> http localhost:5000/api/values

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Thu, 15 Jun 2017 21:41:22 GMT
Server: Kestrel
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

[
    "value1", 
    "value2"
]

```

* To change port from 5000, go to Startup.cs
 
Let's stick with tradition and start with a 'Hello World'. To do this add a Controller.

```
    [Route("helloworld/")]
    public class HelloWorldController: Controller
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public string Get()
        {
            return "Hello World";
        }
    }

```

Run the app and voila we have hello world message on 'localhost:5000/hellworld'

And this is it!. You have created your first microservice. Really, this is simple as that. There is no other magic in it. Sure, as we move on, there will be more 'details', some of them complex. But on the most basic level. Microservice is a service that does 'something' and runs as a standalone piece of software. 

#### So is it really a Microservice?

Yup. But what they are?

Well, it is a service that is micro .. muahahaha ... isn't that simple? Well, it isn't. Microservice is a nice marketing name that caught on with the community. Every innovation has it. Look at Docker and containers. There were people doing this long time ago but it wasn't called container. Now we have a nice name and the hype that generates visibility and demand.

For me, Microservice is a tool to build distributed systems.

Micro is, unfortunately, part of the whole term. It points many people into an incorrect direction (like T in TDD, I am not gonna start this discussion here). Focus on building small components/services that can do 'one thing'. Defining one thing is difficult. A similar problem is with the unit in unit testing.

I like to approach 'one thing' as one functionality, one business functionality. DDD and bounded context are helpful here. You have to remember that there are no strict rules. Your approach to Microservices might be different. We are still establishing patterns and tooling. It is good to experiment right now. 

Knowledge base is build slowly.

#### Core Building Blocks of Microservices

Microservice might differ but there some core 'functionalities' that makes the life easier, and that is a 'standard' now.

In next lesson we will cover three basic blocks:

* Core/Endpoint
* Logging
* HealthCheck

The rest of them lets leave them for the future. 

* Hosting
* Monitoring
* Management
* Registry
