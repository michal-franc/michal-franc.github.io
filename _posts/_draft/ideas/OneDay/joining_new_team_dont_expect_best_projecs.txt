Dont expect best projects when you join a new company. All of them are entrenched by existing employeed with more trust. 
Is is poretty obvious that all the sexy projects will be gived to long time employees, this is one of the ways that company maintains morale within team.

You will have to gain trust before joining the big league, and sometimes wait for older collegues to leave the company.
