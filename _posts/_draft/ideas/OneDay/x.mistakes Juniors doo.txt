X Mistakes Juniors do

1. Commiting too many changes at once
This causes diff to be unreadabale. Allways commit format changes as a separate commit.

2. Commit messages 

3. Reinventing the well
They try to create they solutions without thinking of stuff in the project.

4. Refactor everything ! 
They jump into project only to see mass spaghetti wanting to fix everything at once.

Write about what to refactor when and how to check stuff to refactor
write about Boy Scout Rule

5. Public here, Public there

Everythng in class is public.

6. There is only the LIST

This links with point 4. Know your collections and how to use them.

7. Inheritance instead of Interface based design

They learn about OOD and want to use it everywhere for the sake of using it. Everything is inheriting from something.

8. Communication Maddness

Problem with communication. Too much trash talking.
