Show how introduction of certaings features in frameworks can influence the dev practices

//everyone sharing contect has to remember that they are influencers, people will read their stuff and might really do as they are said
Writing is hard. You need an idea, then you have to write stuff. Which is really difficult trust me - I am constantly adding something and then removing it as it doesn't feel glorious. Everyone would love to write awesome stuff all the time, it is impossible to do this.

Writing becomes even harder when you realize that you can influence other people. They are really reading you and they might listem to you. This realisation changes a lot. We should be really frightened as the stuff you write can change / make habits. 

I am not an F# expert.

Cargo cult examples
- unit testing private functions / mocking (Microsoft )
Microsoft oh microsoft. Back in the TDD inception days, when I was reading books like Art Of Unit Testing by Roy Osherove. I was still strugling with unit tests. Couldn't really yet get it why we shouldnt test private functions. 
- DI into view ( Microsoft )
- Microservices ( Netflix )
- TDD is dead discussions

How to prevent it ?
There is no way to prevent it just remember that people are reading and making notes.
