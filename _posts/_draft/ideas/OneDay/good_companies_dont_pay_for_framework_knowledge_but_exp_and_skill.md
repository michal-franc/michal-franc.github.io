When discussing programming career and how to be succesfull, I often gen into argument that programming job is not only about 'Coding'.
This is quite common for Junior developers to see the job as mostly coding. I am not really surprised about it. This is where you spend most of the time at the beginning. 

In my opinion there are a lot of different skills needed by programmer no be successfuli. Also I think the best companies are looking not only for programming languages and framework knowledge.

Then what skills we can list here and talk about. We can think about two sides of the developer. There's a soft side and technical side, Both of them very important.


Nadal bede sie upieral ze przy takich stawkach firma nie placi za znajomosc jezyka ale za umiejetnosci programowania, komunikacji i ogolnie skill z inynier
programowania. W takich przypadkach jezyk nie ma znaczenia.
