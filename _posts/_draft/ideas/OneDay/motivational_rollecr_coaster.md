Write about what motivates you

Everyone needs self driven and self motivated employee and thats all. Most of the companies I have been in just left the motivation bits for 'random' and never touched them. You will lose developers that way, so beter prepare yourself and learn on how to motivate people.

I am not an expert just an observer of my own behaviours, I am a developer so please read on if you want to know how dev brain works ( this particular dev, I can imagine different people having different needs )
