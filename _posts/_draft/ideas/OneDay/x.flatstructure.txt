Is Flat structure a falacy ?

My take on flat structure
- there is no something like flat structure, there will allways be a structure
  based on human behaviour, friendlienes, vincinity to diffrerent people and
your mental skills.
- flat strcuture can lead to a structure wth holes, what does it mean is that
  people will naturally take over responsibilities in areas that are most
important and areas which are boring, mundane or difficult might be left out
without anynone to handle them.

Concerns from devs

- a lot of devs are afraid of having structure as this is the first step to
  micromagament, sure this can end like that but you can make sure that you
would not end up in this place
- lack of flat structure might mean that the ladder is defined and people
  might feel they dont have the power to move up, flat strucute offers the
promise that you just need to act and be good to move on,its not allways try
for many organisations
- lack of flat strcuture in a opinion of many devs might lead up to politics,
  wars, rat race, but is this really possible to avoid those ?

Other:
- flat strtucute migh end up to chaotic structure when fixed one is more
  stable
