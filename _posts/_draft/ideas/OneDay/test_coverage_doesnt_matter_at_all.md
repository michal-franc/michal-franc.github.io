I had a candidate on an interview who answered to me that he would aim into
60% test coverage.

Why this number ? Why is it hard to find a one answer to rule them all. This
is a typical problem with TDD.

Being proud of 100% test coverage is like being proud of reading every word in the newspaper. Some are more important than others.
