**Why this Series ?** I am 30th now (thirty something). Time flies by, life goes on. I am hoping that this post will be a nice note for my 40 years old version. It's a pity that, I haven't done it when I was 20. That could be a nice source of information. I forgot about my 20 year old version. The same will happen when I hit 40. My current 'mind' is polluted with current point of view. It would be great to get back in time and check how I was thinking, feeling, check the old perspective.

**My dev career started with Duke Nukem 3D ... .** Yes that is true. Duke Nukem 3D is the reason why I am a programmer, well kind of. In fact it was my father that brought me to lan-parties - multiple people gathering together to to have multiplayer fun using LAN. Those were different times, back then it was a magic moment. Waiting 6-12 months for this special day to finally be able to play games with friends. Quake, Duke and many more, those were our games. Instant access to the web, has made multi-player game so 'normal'. I loved it  so much, that later on on I was organizing my own lan-parties. Which were moslty - 1-2 days: soldering cables, fighting with windows and 24 hr of hardcore play time. It was happening only once a year so we had to use time as much as possible.

On one of those lan-parties. There were two guys. Both studying on Wroclaw University of Technology. And they did something special - customized map for Duke Nukem 3D This was something amazing. Their map of course was created in a way that gave them advantage ( hidden passages and stuff around the map ). They also had this early version of a game similar to Warcraft I. It was sprite based mumbo jumbo that really didn't do anything but still my destiny was touched that day. I was so impressed by thei work and what you could do, that I made a decision to go and study at the same University. It was probably 1996-8, I was ten or twelve.

In the coming years, my passion to tech kind of vanished, replaced by football and aspiration of becoming best Goalkeeper in the world ( the times of Saviola, Figo and Kluivert ). Then e-sports came and I spent a lot of time playing Quake 3, Enemy Territory (was pretty good at that one). Which is not unusual, young people change their 'passions', 'interests' all the time. This is how we explore the world.

**When I was 19 the time has come to study.** Getting to Wroclaw University of Technology was my dream. Me, some kid from small town ( 7000 people ) wanting to study in 'big city' in good Polish university. It felt a bit unreal and maybe hard to achieve but I made it. Even with not the best scores. My admission to faculty of Electronic and Telecommunication was accepted. There were 400 of us on first year, after 5 years ( in my case 6, more on this later ) only 60 survived. First three years, I was really struggling. Doing some courses multiple times, failing with maths, failing with legendary course called 'druty' (electromagnetism, circuits, current, resistance calculations and other cool things). I was a bit lazy back then due to 'other' interesting things to do. Move from small town to 'big city' offered many distractions. I was away from home, I had to learn how to live on my own.

**My first job ever.** On 3rd Year due to personal reasons, I had to start working ( before all the expenses where covered by my parents - lucky me ). My first job - clerk in a shop with antiques. I was trying hard to do great job but ... I was fired after the 2nd day. Not sure why, but my 'salary' was 15$ for two days. My first ever money, it was a special day. 2nd job - night shifts in the warehouse. Demanding work and a bit exausting, but the money was okay ( around 300$ / month ). During my 2nd gig, I realised that I have to do something with my life. This is when I probably started realizing that this can't be my future. I decided to learn more and work harder on University.

There were some programming classes. Mostly simple algorithms, C and ASM fun with micro-controllers. It wasn't my passion yet, but those lessons gave me some basic understanding of what is programming. Web development was completely alien to me and mostly brought memories of simple HTML based sites. We had one C# class with a great teacher Dr Kotowski. It was interesting to see language so different to C and ASM. I started spending more and more time with it, doing most of the projects using .NET. Not sure why but probably it really appealed to me.

It was difficult at the beginning. Object oriented programming was non existient and my knowledge was mostly based on Structural programming. Learning Class based approach with mentality 'everything is a class' was different. To grasp those ideas, I started reading 'Thinking in Java' by Bruce Eckel. There were some chapters about OOP and this is where I first read about this 'idea'. Encapsulation or Interface based design those were once again completely unknown concepts. There were of course a lot more buzz words that hasn't ment anything to me. TDD was barerly starting, BDD was probably not there yet, DDD this one I stumbled upon long long time after thanks to [5][Miroslaw Praglowski].

**Hate to unix and Vim** 
- how i hated vim (krzyma) [6][Krzyma]
- how i didnt liked to learn solaris os or other cool operating systems
- how i hated curses and wanted to do it as soon as possible
- how i loved GUI and WIndows based systems
- later on it completely changed and now i love unix, love vim, love console

**Wroc.NET EKA group**	I was happily coding more and more projects in C# (games, math, algorithms) and decided that .NET Framework and C# might be my thing. I started thinking about how to become a programmer and that maybe it would be something cool to do one day. Because of .NET someone introduced me to [2][.NET student group EKA]. It was organized by a group of people that later would become my first employers. At the beginning, I was a bit reluctant to attend those meetings, thinking that I don't know anything. So I forced myself somehow to go and fight my people anxiety.

**My two programming 'heroes'** Attending this group and meeting all the passionate people in .NET space slowly build up my idea of career in programming. Most important moment was when I attended talk from [1][Lukasz Gasior], not sure what it was about, maybe about career. But this was the first time I have listened to a 'real' programmer, someone who was working in the industry! It was a turning point, Lukasz talk had a massive influence on me and my later decisions. Thank you Lukasz.

Later on I also found [0][Maciej Aniserowicz Blog] who also had a huge impression on me. Basically Lukasz and Maciej where my 'programming heroes' that I tried to 'emulate'. It is good to have someone you can relate to and someone you can look up how to progress with your career. My first CV was based on Maciej's CV on his page. I was following both Lukasz and Maciej looking for ideas on how to develop myself.

**More active work in student group** People anxiety was a huge problem for me. I tried to fight with it and read some books like Dale Carnegie - "How to Win Friends and Influence People". It might sound silly but it was helpful. Some of those books mentioned that theory is great but I need a lot more practice. So I did it and moved out of my comfort and forced myself to start 'speaking' in front of people. It started with just brief announcements about group and developed into tens of presentations for students. .NET EKA group was the place where I finally realized, I am good at something and programming could be my Career. Contact with other passionate people also showed me that IT is awesome and community is great.  

**Starting Blog** Encouraged by community, I decided to give something back and started blogging. The general idea was to use blog as a place to share some of the stuff I worked on university. There was no plan for this blog. Well apart for switching to English language which was a nice way to get out of comfort zone, again (It is a common pattern in my life). First posts were very bland, nothing really special but you have to start somewhere. After 6 ( probably ) years. It was worth it! Blogging has helped me tremendously in my career.

**Study End** After 3 years I finally landed on a specialized faculty called Applied Computer Engineering. Things I worked on

	Next was first proper IT job but that is a story for a next blog post.

	- First Programmer Interview
TL;DR I have failed it horribly.
	The time has come
	
- First work
- SHAREPOINT!!!
- Next and Next jobs
	- working in Sweden
	- dotnetconf.pl and speaking
- moving to UK

	- international speaker


	- dotnetconf.pl
- Any Tips ? so Far and observations ?
	
	There is a certain pattern i see with many people
	- passion
	- role models, heroes
	- activity
	- luck
	- forc yourself
