If you know me personally you might now that i was whining a lot about JS 2-3 years ago. Touched by beatifull times of Jquery and crazy spaghetti code I had really bad memories that need to be erased.

Why JS community is getting there with software engineering principles.
How Angular transformed the community. How this communiyt was now reainveting the whell and now is influencing everywone else.
