it is not modern programming
it is just the number of young developers on the market
and lack of enough seniors to support them
this is a very young industry
+ the JS prior to ES6 was ... ehmh how to say it bit shit :D
and whoel community learned not to trust it and build abstractions on top of it
JS doesnt have standards and most of the devs will create chaos, while in .NET, JAVA with the community knowledge, standard, you can transform poor developer into good enough one
they wont hurt themselves


ASk experts on how the JS has evolved and changed with time.
