Get back to this post later when no one will judge you in JE that might be complaining.

I switched jobs recently. Left 'JustGiving' ( I love this company and people there ) and moved to 'Just Eat'. You might noticed similarity in name ... wait till I start my own company 'Just Michal'. Then we will have a great laugh together.

New company, new emotions, new challenges and beloved ... on boarding process. We love it right? Meetings, some basic work to get started and a lot of domain knowledge and context being pushed to you with the speed of light. Don't get me wrong this is one of the most important times for the newcomer. This is were you make the first impressions and establish ground for new relationship, on both sides. 

Once again I am part of onboarding process. Important time for every newcomer and potential disaster or make a big success.

How does it look like usually. Meet Sophia, she is a senior software engineer wit 6+ years of experience.

- A story of a typical process when joining companies with bullets

- Some fuckups from my previous processes.

- Why onboarding is critical
  It is like stage setup before big play. You dont want your actors to be stressed out and waste to on wastefull stuff, you want your engineers to get into the job as soon as possible and be productive as soon as poosible.
  it can either be morale boost or not
  new comers are also evaluating companies
  First impressions set up the stage for long time

- Ideal processs for me how would it look like?

As with all job changes, I am currently being 'on boarded' to a new team, structure, projects, people, domain. It is a very important process and the way it is executed can make it more slow, and painfull, or fast and awesome. Process looked typical. 


Advice to new employees:
Note note note, you are the ultimate tester of the on boarding process. Note verything you liked and disliked and share this wiht your company. This will be greatly appreciated.
