Joining new company changes and challenges

When asked about how to most effectively approach new company i got some advices and book recommendations.

90 days - which wasnt really for me, i just read a summary and meh. But the most important Advice I was given was ... be gentle and open for new things, dont jus jump around and shout this is crap this is shit.

One of the mistakes i did in the past ( sorry my Swedish friends ) was bitching and moaning and whining. Back then i didnt get it that it is not going anywhere. It was i think my way to build position and establish mself as a knowledgable person. Whining about ohter things and ponintng out obviopus problem sis easy, and might seem like hey i am soo clever and inteligent i spotted this shit code, architecture. Well it wont work, people dont like being judged and one thin you wont make friends that way + you are missing the context in which the project was created. There might be certain projects parameters that made this project not perfect and ideal but stil successfull.

When joining new company Listen First act and Do LAter.

Your operate in new enviroment. Your old behaviours and przyzwyczajenia wont work here. There is a diffferent mental model with different behavrious and expectations. this wont work in new place.

You need to build new web of behaviours and strateg. and new postion once againm prove that you are actually good.

First months need to be about data gatering.
