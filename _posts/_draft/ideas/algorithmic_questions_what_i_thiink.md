Algorithmic problems

- how i didnt like these
- how i had a problem accepting that someone might require these
- how i always though that practical knowledge is better

- I discovered that these type of questions is usefull


-----------------------------
Am I the only one who thinks HackerRank-like-tests suck?

Based on what I've seen, it seems a pretty weird way to test technical ability as there's absolutely no practical application involved.

Theoretical based tests are fine, but I find it a tad confusing why some companies don't see the benefit of providing tests which are genuinely engaging and more focused at building solutions to technical problems faced by businesses.

I may be wrong here as I'm just a lowly Tech Recruiter, but what do you guys think? Is it a case of me being naive or am I bang on the money?

By the way, the picture below is how I imagine most of you lovely Devs complete technical tests. Please don't ruin my mental image. :)

I find those tests to be checking if a candidate is able to solve 'new' problems. It is easy to write code, it is easy to learn how to use frameworks. What is difficult then? 

Solving problems. 

Algorithmic problems might feel not practical but you can't just familiarize yourself perfectly with all of them. Most certainly an algorithmic problem if it feels too easy, it will be expanded to get you out of comfort zone and see how you approach 'new' problem, new 'thing'. How do you communicate? How do you establish context, boundaries? How do you split the problem into smaller ones? Do you start with brute force approach and then stop or you are aware that brute force is just the beginning and there are always different solutions with different trade offs? 

There is of course more to it. What is important, algorithmic tests are just part of the process there are more steps. Soft skills, system design. 

Of course, there are different companies, different projects, and different approaches, every recruitment process has to be specifically created for a specific company and their needs.

For me recruitment is still broken, there is a huge opportunity gap on the market to find better approach :)

--------------------------------
Do you not think that the tests are tailored to people who're experienced with those types of tests, rather than tailored to assessing technical ability with regards to a business-specific-challenge?

-------

We can all agree that recruitment is not perfect. It is hard and based on a lot of random factors. Companies use different techniques and 'approaches' with mixed results. There is no one that found the 'perfect' formula - yet. I don't even think that there is one :)

There are different companies with different needs. Some prefer business - practical oriented people, some algorithmic oriented people that based on this give some hint that they can learn fast and think about difficult problems. 

A lot of companies don't know how to do recruitment process based on their needs so they 'follow' the pack leader. Who is considered pack leader in tech? Google, Facebook, Microsoft - big tech companies.

For big tech it works - they have special frameworks, special techniques, and special requirements. Most of the time you can't prepare to work at Google outside of Google. Same with Facebook or Microsoft. A lot of insight knowledge tools and frameworks. Algorithmic type of questions work for them as they hire mostly graduates, graduates are familiar with algorithms and have fresh knowledge. Plus, that is the only way to check the ability of graduate that doesn't have any experience and doesn't understand business goals etc.

In my opinion, one side of the problem is that companies blindly follow the leader hoping that it works for them. 

I never said that algorithmic question is the only one you need to ask. You have to mix both algorithmic and business-specific, soft skills + culture one.

You can ask algorithmic questions that are not super difficult and can lead to interesting discussions. I much more prefer task-oriented challenges like implement at home some user stories based on this data etc.

Every type of question you ask is not perfect, it is always 'tailored' for someone. That is why we need to mix these and based on company create a personalised style of recruitment. If your company/team you are recruiting to is business-oriented, skew the process more towards business. 

If you are hiring someone to work with big scale or performance critical systems change the process and move more towards algorithmic problems.

If you are hiring someone to work in a team responsible for building microservices based system in the cloud, add more emphasis on system design questions.

Even if someone is experienced with algorithmic types of tests you still have more steps in the 'process' to check other traits. Also, an experienced engineer in recruitment process understands that questions/tasks/challenges are just 'discussion' openers. If a candidate is really good with one algorithmic problem you can dig it up and move deeper and deeper, asking more and more complex things, checking the 'limit'.

@jstadnicki slucham slucham i sam kiedys bylem przeciw pytania np o zlozonosc czasowo / pamieciowa
Teraz widze plusy takich pytan - nie oczekuje odpowiediz ale jak ktos ma wg mnie jakies pojecie o algorytmach to w latwy sposob wydedukuje na chlopski rozum jaka moze byc zlozonosc danego algorytmu

W takim pytanie nie wazne jest jak ktos rozwiazuje cos tylko czy np po napisaniu algorytmu w stylu BruteForce kandydat zada sobie pytanie ... czy to dobre rozwiazanie? Z doswiadczenia osoba powinna wiedziec ze BruteForce to tylko poczatek a n^2 zlozonosc np jest nieporzadana i mozna znalezc inna. To mi daje sygnal czy dana osoba zastanawia sie nad tym jaki pisze soft. To potem wg mnie przeklada sie na rzeczy typu ... a napisze sobie handelra ktory wciaga eventy, nie przemysle ze moze byc trhottling nie przemysle ze moze mozna gdzies cachowanie wrzucic tylko brute force handler event i voila, potem takie rzeczy wychodza na produkcji. I takie problemy tez spotkasz w pracy na CRMem czy CRUD appkami. Wg mnie sprawdzenie takiego myslenia jest potem dobrze skorelowane czy ktos rozumie czym np jest Race Condition, i jak dana osoba moze wykric ze tutaj mamy race condition i co z tym zrobic. To wszytko wg mnie laczy sie w obraz danej osoby.

michal-franc 
bo te algorytmy bazowe sa potem przydatne w projektowaniu systemow
jak ktos rozumie divide and conquer
to wie ze ta technika moze byc nie tylko do tego typu algortytmow
zastosowana ale ogolnie do wielu innych problemow
to ze ktos napoisal HomeBrew albo inny soft popularny nie oznacza ze jest dobrym kandydatem do danej firmy :smile:

popularny gosc :smile:
