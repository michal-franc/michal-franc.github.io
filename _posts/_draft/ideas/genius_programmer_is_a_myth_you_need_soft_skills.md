**My programming story started with Duke Nukem 3d**. It is another interesting story, but it won't be revelead in this post. Delphi came later and first RAD applications. I had this big Delphi book that was completely alien to me. It enabled me to build my first applications like: calculator or pong using Forms.

**I shaped my inner engineer on University, with my heores - role models**. This is the best way to grow when you are young. Find a successfull person and try to follow the path. People like Linus were cool but, I was captivated by **Pirates of the Silicon Valley** - creators of Microsoft and Apple. There is a great [low budget movie][0], I watch it every year. This movie introduced me to my first 'heroes', Steves, Bill and forgotten Paul. Their story always motivated me to do more and be better. Why they were my heroes? I was born in Poland and everything from US was considered great. We can call it a dominant culture effect. On the other hand from my point of view, their were visible and their 'success' was extra-ordinary. I wanted to achieve the same even when I knew that it was impossible. It is not like I did't belevie in myself, but you can't do the same thing, you can't follow the same road. My context and enviroment was different. Still they served as a beacon / goal of my journey. Beacuse all, I focused on was engineering, I was looking at 'Woz' mostly. Jobs for me was - someone who stole 'Woz' product and sold it. Becuse you know, selling is simple. 'Woz' was the genius not Jobs. Engineers are the most important beacuse they are the ones building the products / software.

**I want to be like Woz, I want to be a genius.** Surely all the money and stuff will come later. There will be someone that will pay for my genius skills. Who is a genius programmer? On University there was a lot of 'Computer Science', Algorithms, Data Structures, Optimizations etc. Yes this is what I will focus on. I will be the best engineer in the world and that is how I ll get to my heroes level.

- How I created a myth of a genius programmers who are just excellent at computer science and how this affected me ( how i felt I am shit )
  - link to ZEd Shaw derailiong progrmamers myths

**Let's talk about Elon Musk**. 

wg mnie geniusze nie istniejam sa tylko wytworem po kultury ktorej latwiej wytlumaczyc ze ktos byl geniuszem miast pokazywac ile ta osoba wlozyla pracy w to oraz jaki zespol ludzi stal za tym geniuszem

- What are the traits of a mythical genius programmer?

- How does a programmer work in normal workspace and how does it differ
 - What are the traits of great programmers imo

nie stworzysz algorytmow leczacych raka bez komunikaji i kontaktu ze specjalistami od onkologi
musisz umiec wydestylowac te wiedze
samo napisanie algorytmu to juz prosta zabawa ktora junior dev po studiach wyklepie
owszem w takiej sytuacji mozesz miec analityka ktora ci wydestyluje te wiedze
ale i tak uwazam ze stereotypowy inzynier geniusz ktory ma problemy w komunikacji bedzie duzo duzo mniej efektywny niz sredni inzynier ktory ma tez umiejetnosci miekkie
geniusze to mit, 99% sukcesu to kolaboracja ktora wymaga umiejetnosci miekkich

- Even mythical PHD's who are considered the ultimate awesome jobs

nawet PHD czyli koronny przyklad R&D musza walczyc o granty, sprzedawac swoje pomysly, publikowac pracem artykul
robic prezentacje, jezdzic na sympozia

- **Lets talk about Steves** - Wozniak my hero and Jobs helped him.
mozna przytoczyc przyklad Wozniaka i Apple ale on mial Jobsa ktory zrobil za niego te robote

- **Lets talk about John** - 
Carmack example even him a guru of all the introvers is selling stuff and neeeds sfot skills
