----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Different types of scale - spike and sustained or linear
- What is the spike when it happens what kind of products have issues with spike


- What was the problem we have been solving

One big spike  two services two bounded contextx queue beetwen them. Spike was generated in 1min. 

Other services writing data to DYnamoDB with limited write capacity.

- How we throttled the consumer - tests differences
- How i think consumer should be controlling this trhottling and not producer

- Other approaches?
  - batching
  - pull mechanism
