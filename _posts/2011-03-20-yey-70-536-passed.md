<p>I passed my first ms exam <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/Exam.aspx?ID=70-536&amp;Locale=en-us">Microsoft .NET Framework â€“ Application Development Foundation.</a> Some questions were simple and some quite difficult , with a lot of details. I spent quite some time to prepare. Some concepts like <strong>Code Access Security</strong> or <strong>App Domains</strong> , well this was something&#160; new to me.</p>  <p>This is just the beginning . Next step 70-562.</p>
