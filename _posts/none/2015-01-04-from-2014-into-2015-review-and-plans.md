A lot has happened in the last year 2014.
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">I moved to London which was not that easy task. Moving abroad proofed more difficult than, I thought and those estate agents ... I don't want to start.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Started working for an awesome company <a href="https://home.justgiving.com/">JustGiving</a>. I am glad and happy that, I can work with so many awesome people on projects that have an impact. It is really good to work for Tech4Good company.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Finally, I invested heavily into learning about functional programming.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Spent a lot of time organizing my TDD knowledge, couple of books + one nice workshop with Roy Osherove.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">I did some talks in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95fhFUuQ9u0">Polish</a> / English dev groups.</span></li>
	<li>Organized <a href="http://dotnetconf.pl/">dotnetconf.pl</a> with Pawel and Jakub.</li>
</ul>
What I want to do in 2015 ?
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Again, functional programming all the way. This is the 'thing', I want to go for now and see what happens. It was really refreshing to learn about it and use it in some practical projects.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">DDD, I need to gain more knowledge about it. It was always there, I have read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">blue book by EE</a> but I think, I wasn't mature enough to really grasp it. I have heard good things about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577">Implementing DDD by VV</a>, probably will start with this book.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Speaking activities, I need to do more speaking to learn from my mistakes and get better.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Artificial Intelligence, AI will be a great source of problems complex enough so that, I can use functional programming with it. I always wanted to start learning about AI, it is something that really interests me, apart from history and sci-fi. Will see what happens, I have already started last year by refreshing my knowledge from uni and gaining little 'foothold' in this broad and complex subject. You will see some posts about AI for sure.</span></li>
</ul>
