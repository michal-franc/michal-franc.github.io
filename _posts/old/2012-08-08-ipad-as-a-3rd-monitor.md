<p>I am not apple fan, but I am really surprised how useful <strong>IPad</strong> is.</p>  <p>I am mostly using it for :</p>  <ul>   <li>rss / pocket / book / mail reader </li>    <li>evernote </li>    <li>some games ( hero academy is awesome ) </li> </ul>  <p>Apart from great apps and games you can use your <strong>IPad</strong> as a 3rd monitor.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rculh.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px" title="rculh" border="0" alt="rculh" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rculh_thumb.jpg" width="634" height="476" /></a></p>  <p align="justify">This is possible thanks to <strong><a href="http://avatron.com/apps/air-display/">AirDisplay</a></strong>. This app uses <strong>WIFI</strong> network to send/receive data. Of course <strong>IPad</strong> and your <strong>PC </strong>have to be in the same network. It works really nice with <strong>win7. </strong>You can drag and drop normal windows, change layout of&#160; screens and touch events are ok (there is a little lag but I got used to it). Unfortunately screen on tablet is doesn’t have instant refresh but it’s really good if you want to show something little static.</p>  <p align="justify">For past 4 days I have been using this setup to display logs from my app. It works really awesome. In the future I will try to use this idea more. Sketching, drawing, displaying some ideas. I could even drag some window with part of the code and go to my colleague at work <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wlEmoticon-smile.png" /> that seems cool.</p>
