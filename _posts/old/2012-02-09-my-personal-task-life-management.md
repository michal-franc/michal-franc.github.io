<p align="justify">Once upon a time there was a pure chaos in my life. Do whatever you want and whenever you have time. That was fun … for a while. When I was studying this worked fine, but&nbsp; then I started working and suddenly everything changed. Time became very expensive. I realized that it’s time to try and manage this chaos by organizational changes. This would hopefully get me more valuable time or at least I would be able to use it wisely.</p> <p align="justify">I started with <strong>GTD (Getting Things Done).</strong> Applied and tried it for about a year, but …. Well as usual I overcomplicated this simple solution with time estimations, time tracking. It started to feel like, I was spending most of the time maintaining <strong>GTD </strong>lists. It was getting more and more complicated. Something was wrong it shouldn’t supposed to work like that. My precious time was wasted on “management”.</p> <p align="justify">Again I had to change my planning. <strong>GTD</strong> wasn’t for me. I stumbled upon one of the presentation in Krakow by <a href="http://blog.brodzinski.com/"><strong>Paweł Brodziński</strong></a> about <strong>Kanban. </strong>Presentation about project planning on cork board seemed cool and nice, I bought cork board some stickers and tried something new.</p> <p align="justify">In this post, I will describe my current time/task management workflow which is at the moment working quite fine ( maybe because of the "new thing” hype <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout" alt="Smile with tongue out" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout.png"> ).</p> <h4 align="justify">Long Term Planning</h4> <p align="justify">First of all let’s start with something that everyone should do from time to time. <strong>Long Term Planning. </strong>Before doing anything else, I am thinking about what I m going to do this month, year and what kind of goals, I want to accomplish, in the long run. This is really important, because it lets me think about my life and where should I go next. </p> <p align="justify">I divide stuff into <strong>four</strong> areas<strong>:</strong></p> <ol> <li> <div align="justify"><strong>Personal – </strong>friends, family, girlfriend etc.</div> <li> <div align="justify"><strong>Physical – </strong>health, fitness, activities etc..</div> <li> <div align="justify"><strong>Technical&nbsp; - </strong>programming, math, algorithms etc.</div> <li> <div align="justify"><strong>Social</strong> – planning, speaking, teaching, managing etc..</div></li></ol> <p align="justify">Of course I will change this list a bit in the course of the year. But those are always minor tweaks. Also those points will provide nice knowledge about myself in the future.</p> <p align="justify">It is really important to have a game plan of your life <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" alt="Winking smile" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png">. Life is very complicated and most of the time we can only adapt to the situations. Control can be easily lost. With long term plans, I feel more secure for such situations.</p> <h4 align="justify">Personal Kanban</h4> <p align="justify">I mentioned <a href="http://blog.brodzinski.com/"><strong>Paweł Brodziński</strong></a>&nbsp; and <strong>Kanban </strong>with some try and errors, I managed to create my own workflow for tasks. Cork board and sticky notes are really awesome. </p> <p align="justify"><a href="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image_thumb.png" width="523" height="331"></a></p> <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p> <p align="justify">This is my awesome board. I Divide it into <strong>four</strong> areas.</p> <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p> <p align="justify"><a href="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image1.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image_thumb1.png" width="521" height="336"></a></p> <ol> <li> <div align="justify"><strong>Waiting</strong> – tasks that are waiting to be done</div> <li> <div align="justify"><strong>Doing</strong> – tasks that. I am currently working on</div> <li> <div align="justify"><strong>Done</strong> – tasks that have been finished in the current week</div> <li> <div align="justify"><strong>Week log</strong> – place for finished tasks from previous weeks, there are four stacks for each week, so I have log of what I did in this month</div></li></ol> <p align="justify"><strong></strong><a href="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image2.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image_thumb2.png" width="245" height="304"></a></p> <p align="justify">Between areas <strong>Doing</strong> and <strong>Done,</strong> I have two narrow openings that can contain only two tasks. Those are things that, I am working atm.</p> <p align="justify">Sticky notes are in different <strong>color</strong> and of course this also has it’s purpose. Tasks are divided into six groups.</p> <ul> <li> <div align="justify"><strong>red</strong> – important</div> <li> <div align="justify"><strong>green</strong> – learn</div> <li> <div align="justify"><strong>blue</strong> – blog</div> <li> <div align="justify"><strong>pink</strong> – events,speaker</div> <li> <div align="justify"><strong>orange</strong>- projects</div> <li> <div align="justify"><strong>yellow</strong> – personal</div></li></ul> <p align="justify"><a href="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image3.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/image_thumb3.png" width="189" height="244"></a></p> <p align="justify">There are also tasks that have two colors like on this screen. That means that this task is in two groups and in this case, when I finish the project I will write a blog post about it <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout" alt="Smile with tongue out" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wlEmoticon-smilewithtongueout.png"></p> <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p> <h4 align="justify">Cork Board vs Software</h4> <p align="justify">At first I was a bit reluctant to use cork board and old fashioned sticky notes.</p> <p align="justify">Now I only can only say that it is awesome <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" alt="Winking smile" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png"></p> <ul> <li> <div align="justify">Cork board is always visible. You don’t need to switch windows or buy new screen.</div> <li> <div align="justify">It has limited space. So I am not able to add hundreds of not important tasks <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-winkingsmile" alt="Winking smile" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png"></div> <li> <div align="justify">it forces you to do something physical, move your body. That’s quire engaging and brain loves it.</div></li></ul> <p align="justify">There is only one problem with this. What to do with recursive tasks ? Tasks that are repeating all the time. For those tasks I m using an android app called Due Today. It is really awesome and handy. Maybe in the future, I will find way to incorporate this logic into board.A lot will change, and I will adapt some things but that’s the beauty of this. By try and error I m creating something that feels good at the moment and is quite motivating <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Smile" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wlEmoticon-smile.png"> (because I feel the freshness in it)</p>
