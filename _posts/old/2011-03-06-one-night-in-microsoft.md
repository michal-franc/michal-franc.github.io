<p align="justify">.Net group from Wroclaw University of Technology was invited by Microsoft to the event in their HQ in Warsaw . It was a first gathering of .Net groups from our country. Almost 200+ students showed up. Microsoft had problems with overcrowded hall but it was ok. As name suggests it was a all night event.</p>  <p align="justify">It was all about fun :</p>  <ul>   <li>     <div align="justify">Couple of great presentations about Career in IT , WP7 Development and new Features in IE 9. </div>   </li>    <li>     <div align="justify">Lot of contest. Chees games , Guitar Hero Contest , Speaker Idol , Karaoke contest. Of course everything with nice prizes. </div>   </li> </ul>  <p align="justify">MS invests lot of resources into academic communities. This is a smart move. If a young developer or IT pro starts career on MS Stack , there is a big probability that he will stay here.In a long run this means more business and money for Microsoft. </p>  <p align="justify">&#160;</p>  <p align="justify"><a href="http://lammichalfranc.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/image.png"><img style="background-image:none;padding-left:0;padding-right:0;display:block;float:none;padding-top:0;border-width:0;margin:0 auto 5px;" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lammichalfranc.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/image_thumb.png" width="396" height="321" /></a></p>  <p align="justify">&#160;</p>  <p align="justify">Great event we had a lot of fun especially on “Kinect” and Xbox. We also tried MS Surface.I really liked the friendly&#160; atmosphere in the MS. It’s a pity that I wont be able to attend next year edition.</p>
