In this blog post we will answer the question `What is a calling convention?`. A calling convention is like a contract that describes how the functions call each other, on the `assembly` level using `cpu` instructions`.

## Calling Convention

It defines things like:

- the way arguments are passed to a function
- how values are returned
- how the function name is decorated
- who: `caller` or `calle` handles `stack` or `registers` clean up

> It specifies how (at a low level) the compiler will pass input parameters to the function and retrieve its results once it's been executed.[^calling-convs-so]

## CPU, Machine code and instruction sets

If we go down to the lowest levels of `code`, there is a `machine code`[^machine-code].

[^machine-code]:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language)

This BTW is a Fibonacci number generation code in `machine code`. I wouldn't be able to write it that way, but what is important is that on this `lowest level` it really doesn't matter if this code  comes from `C++`, `Java`, `Python` or `C#`. It would an `impossible` task(almost) to write code that way. That is why we have a higher abstraction on top of machine code - `assembly` language. 

Example below is the same `fibonacci number` generation code but in `assembly`.

{% highlight asm %}

{% endhighlight %}

On this level which is still very low. We operate very close to the `CPU` using - registers, stacks, and CPU instructions like `mov` or `jmp`. Every CPU supports different `registers` and `instructions`[^instruction-sets].

First micro processor[^first-micro-processor] had `46` instructions[^i4004-instruction-set]. These days you can check this list [^instructions-listings], there are hundreds of them. It all started with simple instructions, which were used to generate more complex operations. As these operations become very common, CPU designer added them as new instructions, often designing CPUs to make them more optimized.

Then there is also a difference between `(RISC)ARM` and `(CISC)x86` processors. The former have smaller number of instructions but require fewer transistors making them more power efficient[^arm-vs-x86-so].

You can check the difference down below.

{% endhighlight %}

It is the same code but on different CPU families with different instruction sets. Due to this difference you need to compile the code for a specific machine. If you are familiar with Linux world, it is pretty standard procedure to download source code of some program and build it itself on your machine for your machine specific context. More popular distributions have packages with already pre-compiled binaries. Usually when you go to a release page of some software - example (ripgrep [^ripgrep]) you will see different binaries, for different operating systems, Linux, kernels or families of CPUs. (BTW ripgrep is an amazing replacement of grep).

[^ripgrep]:[Ripgrep release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases)

This is partially why `virtual machine` was created with platforms like `JAVA` or `.NET`. It helps with portability of software as instead of compiling your code to a specific instruction set. You compile it to intermediary language `IL` or `Java Bytecode` which is then compiled, usually lazily on the fly, by the Virtual machine to this machine specific context. It automates the whole process of building the code for your . 

## Functions in assembly

On this low level we operate with CPU instructions. The concept of function, argument, returning value from a function doesn't exist. We can only use `simple` primitives like accumulator, registers, stack, label and CPU instructions. These primitives can be used to create more complex code and something similar to functions.

{% highlight c %}
int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This code is readable and it has concepts of types `int`, function, arguments, `+` operator, return and of course scope `{}`.

{% highlight c %}
sum:                          <- label
  mov edx, DWORD PTR [esp+4]  <- move value a from stack to register
  mov eax, DWORD PTR [esp+8]  <- move value b from stack to register
  add eax, edx                <- add b to a
  ret                         <- return
{% endhighlight %}

When you compile this code to assembly. You get a different view with things like labels `sum:`, CPU instructions `mov, add, ret`, operation on stack `[esp+4]`, stack pointer `esp` and  registers `edx, eax`. It is a completely different world.

Looking at this code you might ask:

* Ok I see `ret` function which I assume is return, but how does it work? 
* Which value is returned?
* If I call it how will another function how to get the value?

And that is why we have `calling conventions` to create a contract with information for functions on how to call each other.

Calling conventions can differ in many ways:

* where are the arguments stored - registers, stack
* where do you put the result of the function call (stack, register, memory)
* who is responsible for clean-up - caller or callee ( this makes a difference in assembly code size, if caller is cleaning up the stack - the compiler has to generate clean-up instructions next to the function call)
* who is responsible for `cleaning` up `registers` and bringing them back to previous state (before the function was called)

You can check the list of x86 calling conventions here [^x86-conventions]. We will use `cdecl` and `fastcall` as an example.

[^x86-conventions]:[X86 calling conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions)

## CDECL and FASTCALL

If one of the functions expects call using `cdecl` convention. It is expecting:

* arguments to be on the stack
* caller cleaning the stack

If we then call this function using `fastcall` convention both requirements won't be met:

* for fastcall first `three` (for Microsoft `two`) arguments are kept in the registers
* stack won't be cleaned up as fastcall assumes that `callee` is responsible for that.


{% highlight c %}

__attribute__((cdecl)) int cdecl(int a, int b) {
      return a * b;
}

int caller() {
    return cdecl(2, 3);
}

{% endhighlight %}
Source code [^cdecl-example].

[^cdecl-example]:[cdecl sample](https://godbolt.org/g/qTgVGm)

This simple function `multiplies` numbers. We have function  `cdecl` which is marked with `cdecl` attribute to force this calling convention (this is actually default and this attribute is not needed).

I am compiling this code with these flags:

* `-m32` - forces 32 bit executable - without this flag calling conventions are ignored (couldn't find why)
* `-O0` - I don't want to optimize this code as with such a simple example `-O1` in the caller puts a static value `(2 * 3 = 6)`
* `-fomit-frame-pointer` - one optimization that removes `frame pointers` to make the `asm` code a bit simpler. (At the end of this post there is a example without this optimization explained if you are curious what is the difference).

> -fomit-frame-pointer   
> Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that don't need one. This avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available in many functions. It also makes debugging impossible on some machines. [^fomit-frame-pointer]

It removes these instructions.

{% highlight c %}
  - push ebp      <- preserve the caller function entry point on the stack
  - mov ebp, esp  <- point ebp to this function stack frame pointer (create stack frame)
...
  - pop ebp       <- restore entry point from the stack of the calling function to be able to go back
{% endhighlight %}

[^fomit-frame-pointer]:[Omit frame pointer flag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14666665/trying-to-understand-gcc-option-fomit-frame-pointer)

This simplifis the code to this form.

{% highlight c %}
cdecl:
  mov eax,  DWORD PTR [ebp+4] -> move value 'a' from the stack to  eax
  imul eax, DWORD PTR [ebp+8] -> multiply eax by 'b' from the stack
                              -> in cdecl called function expects arguments on the stack
  ret

caller:
  push 3                      -> push `a` to the stack
  push 2                      -> push `b` to the stack 
                              -> in cdecl arguments are pushed to the stack
  call cdecl
  add esp, 8                  -> 'clean up' the stack by moving the pointer
                              -> in cdecl caller cleans up the stack
  ret
{% endhighlight %}

For comparison lets look at `fastcall`.

{% highlight c %}

__attribute__((fastcall)) int fastcall(int a, int b, int c) {
      return a * b * c;
}

int caller() {
    return fastcall(2, 3, 4);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Source code [^example-fastcall-asm].

[^example-fastcall-asm]:[Fcall sample](https://godbolt.org/z/TSn4K9)

I added `third` parameter to show that only first `two` arguments are passed through the registers.

{% highlight c %}
fastcall:
  sub esp, 8                   -> reserve place on the stack
  mov DWORD PTR [esp+4], ecx   -> move `a` to the stack
  mov DWORD PTR [esp], edx     -> move `b` to the stack
  mov eax, DWORD PTR [esp+4]   -> move `a` from stack to eax
  imul eax, DWORD PTR [esp]    -> multiply `a` on eax by `b`
  imul eax, DWORD PTR [esp+12] -> multiply by `c` on the stack
  add esp, 8                   -> clean up the stack
  ret 4                        -> return to the caller and move stack pointer cleaning up `c`
{% endhighlight %}

For simplicity we can simplify this code to this.

{% highlight c %}
fastcall:
  mov eax, ecx                 -> move `a` to eax
  imul eax, edx                -> multiply eax by `b`
  imul eax, DWORD PTR [esp]    -> multiply eax by `c`
  ret 4
{% endhighlight %}

There is no need to reserve place on the `stack`, move values from registers to the `stack` and then get values from the `stack`. Compiler potentially does it due to `consistency`.

> Arguments are first saved in stack then fetched from stack, rather than be used directly. This is because the compiler wants a consistent way to use all arguments via stack access, not only one compiler does like that. [^fastcall-diss]

[^fastcall-diss]:[Fastcall diss](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Disassembly/Calling_Convention_Examples)

In the end we will analyse this code.

{% highlight c %}
fastcall:
  mov eax, ecx              move `a` to eax 
  imul eax, edx             multiply `a` in the eax by `b` in edx
                            -> in fastcall called function expects arguments in the registers
  imul eax, DWORD PTR [esp] multiply `a*b` by `c` on the stack, esp is pointing at the top of stack
                            -> in fastcall third parameters is on the stack
  ret 4                     -> return to the caller and clean-up stack from `c`
                            -> in fastcall called function is cleaning up the stack
caller:
  push 4                    -> move `c` to the stack
                            -> in fastcall third argument is passed using stack
  mov edx, 3                -> move `a` to edx
  mov ecx, 2                -> move `b` to ecx
                            -> in fastcall first 2 arguments are passed by registers
  call fastcall   
  ret
{% endhighlight %}

So this is it. Examples of differences between `fastcall` and `cdecl`. What would happen then if we would `mix` conventions. Example below shows what happens when a `caller` and `calle` are not abiding to the same convention.

{% highlight c %}
fastcall:
  mov eax, ecx    -> `fastcall` expects arguments on the registers
  imul eax, edx   
  ret
caller:
  push 3          -> but caller pushed arguments to the stack
  push 2         
  call fastcall
  add esp, 8 
  ret
{% endhighlight %}

`fastcall` still thinks that arguments were passed through registers and obviously there will be `some` data. It is not the data passed by the caller as he used `cdecl` conventions and passed arguments through the stack. This would generate an unexpected and hard to debug behaviour. That is why `calling conventions` are important. There is a long history behind them [^cc-history1][^cc-history2][^cc-history3][^cc-history4]
