<p>Total Commander is a great file management tool. You can download shareware version which you can use for 1 month <a href="http://www.ghisler.com/">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>1. Global Ignore List </strong><br />
In Sharepoint i am always versioning all the files. When copying files to sharepoint 12 Hive there is always a problem with .svn directories. They are making a nice mess and I was wasting a lot of time deleting them. Total Commander has a nice feature which can with this. Ignore List. You can add files , directories  and they wont be copied. Unfortunately there is a minor problem , those files are also filtered from views ;[</p>

<p><strong>2. SlickRun + TotalCommander</strong></p>
<p>I have made a post abotu  <a href="http://lammichalfranc.wordpress.com/2009/11/23/slickrun/"> SlickRun </a> [it's right now in polish]. This is a great program. You can define various macros and run multiple different commands , applications really fast. For example one of mine commands is the “Forums” which opens 10+ www pages in chrome. I have integrated the SlickRun with a Total Commander command line parameters and for one of the projects created a great shortcut to run TC with the bin folder on the left and debug folder on the right.</p>

<p>There are more useful commands. More info in the TC help.</p>
<p><strong>3. Num + ,- and  Num *<strong></p>
<p>By clicking Num +  you can write a regular expression which will select all the files in the current directory , Num – deselects the files and Num * Inverts the selection. The plus option is really great especially when you are cleaning your Desktop :D</p>
