I have started this blog in 2009, back then I lived in Wroclaw, 5 years later ( 2014 ) I moved to London.

I am passionate about programming and problem solving. It all started with coder mindset : do stuff, have fun and code, code, code. Since then I have evolved a lot and now my passion is mostly about problem solving. It doesn't matter if it is a technical problem or organisational stuff. There is always something that I can help with. It is funny, because as a introvert I loved mostly the technical side of my carrer. I even thought that your technical abilities are just all you need to succeed. This attitude has changed, I found out that you need awesome communication, teamwork, negotiation, maturity and emotional intelligence, in order to succeed. Without soft skills you are empty.

I have helped several companies, worked within couple domains: e-commerce, finance, web-apps. Currently, I am in charities sector, changing world with <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/">JustGiving</a>.

All of this fun, started with C and C++, there was also some asm and Java, but it was C# that transformed me. After graduation Love to code on hardware level changed to web programming. I had some fun as full stack dev, then I moved to more backend-ish world. I have spent some time exploring world of JS, Node, NoSql, i still am but nowadays I am mostly trying to figure out how to use stuff like DDD, TDD and functional programming to help companies and organisation get stuff done. I am also having some fun with Python and AI programming.

I am a huge fan of VIM, Bash and command line. I do hate Visual Studio ( still forced to using it ). There was some love to R# but now I am trying to get away from it. I forgot about Git, yep I love it.

I am a huge believer of self-organising teams, and I would love to become an awesome leader, that can inspire and motivate his teammates to do great things. I find it really rewarding when I can help people reach their potential. One of my biggest super powers is : mentoring and life coaching, so if you need some advice just reach me out.

Apart from coding, I spend a lot of time reading stuff ( huge history nut ), playing complex games ( huge wargame nut ). Ocassionaly you can find me speaking somewhere on some interesting topic or organising events like <a href="http://www.dotnetconf.pl">dotnetconf.pl</a>.

I don't bite and I am always open for making new friends and connections, so come on tell me something about yourself.
