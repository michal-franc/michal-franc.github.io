<h3>Q: Is University degree really that important for future career in IT. Wouldn't it be better to start working as soon as possible and even sacrifice studying for more work related experience. I am a student now and I do feel now that studying is limiting my potential and growth.</h3>

<p>Time for laying the foundation for later learning.<br />
Studying is a great catalyst for the future growth.<br />
It's a time to build your network.</p>
<p>A: University time is a beautiful time. Its a moment when you have the opportunity to learn many different things, try different technologies and gain a lot of theoretical knowdledge. It is really important to try and experiment with everything as much as possible. I am not talking here about languages or frameworks but also different areas of computer science. I was doing ASM programming, C Programming, OOP programming, database programming, Image recognition algorithms implementations, bird flocks simulation etc plus i spent some time soldering and programming micro controllers. When I joined the work market it also felt like a knowledge that is not needed at all. My first job I was developing web parts for Salesforce. It was really hard for me to find a correlation beetwen things that I learned at Unit and things that I did in the workplace. Time has passed and now i think completely differnet. Stuyding is important as it lets you build a base for future growth. You cant build a house without laying fundaments first. You have to start fromt the bottom. By learning and trying many different concepts you are training your brain to learn faster and you are creating connection in your brain that will make enchance your learning capabilities. Learning is something that you need to train. Also learning about new concepts is a lot easier if you already know many difrferent concepts. Thats why I encourage everyone to try as much as possibgle on UNI. Dont focus on one platform and dont focus on gaining marketable skills. The time will come for that later. Try to reach out your professors and discuss some technologies, frameworks concepts that you would want to try out. All of this will start reapying after 4-5 years in the market when you will realize that developer job is not to create a code but find solutions and new ways to generate value for your users or your client users. In a summary, focus ons studyin :) Sure you can do some work and work for some companies, just try to not stress out about it and dont let it become the main focus of your Uni time.</p>

<p>- Psychological aspect as it meaks your stronger and you tend to belevei more in yourself with deegre and a form of accomplishements</p>
<p>- study is a great time to grow up and try to find a way in your life</p>
<p>- when it comes to companies i have heard that some of them do require deegres + there is a barrier of HR departments</p>
