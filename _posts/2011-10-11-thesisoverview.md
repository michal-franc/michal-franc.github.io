<p align="left">After couple of months spent on developing, my thesis is finally finished (yeah to be hones it's a beta version)! Happy happy day ;] Working and studying (which is was quite similar to work) is quite exhausting.I have created the e-learning platform. Its core functionality is content management + learning process management.  <h3 align="left"><b>Technologies and Tools used in Project:</b></h3> <h4 align="left"><b><a href="http://nlog-project.org/">NLog</a> + <a href="http://sentinel.codeplex.com/">Sentinel</a></b></h4> <p align="left">NLog is awesome ! It's easy and flexible. I will stick with it in my projects. Every app should implement logging mechanism because it simplifies development and cuts time spent on debugging code. Sentinel is a tool used to view generated logs. It supports for NLog and log4net. Sentinel is still in early development phase and needs improvements but it's ok.  <p align="left">In my scenario i had a dual screen setup ( monitor + laptop screen). Laptop was used as a log windows with sentinel.  <h4 align="left"><b><a href="http://nhforge.org/Default.aspx">NHibernate</a> + <a href="http://fluentnhibernate.org/">FluentNhibernate </a></b></h4> <p align="left">NHibernate has step learning curve ( at least for someone like me with noob skills in ORM's) but its great, flexible and greatly simplifies Data Abstraction Layer implementation. I had couple of situatioon when, I had to do massive changes in the DB. With DAL in NHibernate it was easy task. For NH mappings i have used FluentNhibernate. This lib has some flaws and problems like weak sql stored procedure support but i really don't like the idea of xml files.  <h4 align="left"><b><a href="http://www.nunit.org/">NUnit</a> + <a href="http://hibernatingrhinos.com/open-source/rhino-mocks">RhinoMock</a></b></h4> <p align="left">Whole DAL is covered by unit tests (all the repository methods and service methods). I m using NUnit because this was my first test framework and i got used to it. In this project i have used for the first time Mocking Framework. Why RhinoMock well, I am reading <a href="http://ayende.com/blog">Ayende's Blog </a>and thought that's this one will be good at the beginning. There are currently more than 120 tests.  <h4 align="left"><b><a href="http://automapper.codeplex.com/">Automapper </a></b></h4> <p align="left">I m using Automapper to convert between different classes. My DAL is behind WCF services and, I'm using DTO's as a transfer class. With Automapper conversion from NH entity to DTO is really simple.  <h4 align="left"><b><a href="http://ninject.org/">Ninject</a></b></h4> <p align="left">This was my first time experience with DI frameworks. It works really well and is quite simple but recently i found a performance comparison and Ninject is very slow compared to other solutions. I was using Unity at work and, I m gonna try it with other projects.  <p align="left">&nbsp; <h3 align="left"><b>Architecture</b></h3> <p align="center"><strong><a href="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/architektura.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="architektura" border="0" alt="architektura" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/architektura_thumb.jpg" width="662" height="307"></a></strong></p> <p align="center">This is a simple architecture of my app.</p> <h4 align="left">Graphical Design</h4> <p align="left"><a href="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Logowanie.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="Logowanie" border="0" alt="Logowanie" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Logowanie_thumb.jpg" width="405" height="311"></a></p> <p align="left">Log in Screen</p> <p align="left"><a href="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/mainpage.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="mainpage" border="0" alt="mainpage" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/mainpage_thumb.jpg" width="407" height="249"></a></p> <p align="left">Main Page</p> <p align="left"><a href="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/course.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="course" border="0" alt="course" src="http://www.mfranc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/course_thumb.jpg" width="406" height="270"></a></p> <p align="left">Course Page</p> <p align="left">I am using <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/adminica-the-professional-admin-template/160638">Adminica Template.</a> Great Stuff !</p> <p align="left"><b>&nbsp;</p></b> <p align="left">It was quite a big project for me. I learned a lot and tried different solutions. After my graduation i will work <i>maybe</i> on it as a open source project.
