<p align="justify">It is almost the end of the year. Hopefully we will get through Armageddon on 21st December, so following <a href="http://blog.klimczyk.pl/">Pawel Klimczyk</a> idea, I am posting my own list of personal goals for 2013 year.</p>
<!---more---->
<h3>Prepare a session for <a href="http://wrocnet.org/">wroc .net</a></h3>
<p align="justify">I was planning to do this for a long time. There are couple of ideas that, I could talk about. This year, I have done some presentations for students. This was fun, I always enjoy it.</p>

<h3>Read more books / watch more screencasts / write more blog posts</h3>
<p align="justify">I have a big list of stuff. There is still <a href="http://oredev.org/">Oredev</a>, <a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/">NDC</a> waiting, and a big pile of books. Also i have to try and write more often. One post per month is unacceptable. I increased my activity on <a href="https://twitter.com/francmichal">Twitter</a> so the time has come for blog. I have a lot ideas but motivation is not one of my best friends, also decision that I am going to write everything in English makes a lot of things difficult. I still have a lot to learn on writing not in my native language.</p>

<h3>RoR project</h3>
<p align="justify">There was a time when i only focused on .Net stack, but then I started to use GIT and I fell in love with BASH and keyboard only habit. This led me to Ruby on Rails. I am currently learning it and doing some little fun project for myself.</p>

<h3>Get Involved with some open source projects</h3>
<p align="justify">I have some little projects hosted on <a href="https://github.com/LaMik">Github</a> but still, I havenâ€™t tasted any pull request for some open source project. This has to change. I will try and focus on some of the frameworks, I am using in my every day job and hobby projects.</p>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">It is not so much but, I have to focus on the most important goals.</p>
