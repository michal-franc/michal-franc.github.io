<p>Projects, source code, different concepts. Those are the byproducts of our work . Every programmer in his carrer develops a lot of different stuff.</p>
<p>I allways planned to host mine "toys" somewhere. Sure there there is github, assembla and other hosting possibilities, but to be honest I need more customization options, and the feeling that I can do something on my own is tempting. There is also NanyFx framework that I read good things about, I just had to try it out and created simple site <a href="http://www.projects.mfranc.com">www.projects.mfranc.com</a>.</p>
<p>This will be my playgroud for Knockout.js, Nancy framework, SignalIR, Twitter Bootstrap and other cool stuff. Nancy is quite awesome and it is a something new for me. I like the "less code" feeling. Compared to Asp.Net Mvc there is quite a huge gain in number of lines.</p>
<p>I tried out Nancy, which is based on Sinatra framework from RoR community. My first impressionit is good. I like the whole idea of writing less code. Also I think that "modules" are more readable and maintanable beacuse you are forced to simplify your "controller" layer. This leads to really good code. The only problem I had was the lack of knowledge/documentation available on the Web. While developing I enountered some problems that took me a while to fix. This won't be a problem with more mature product, bigger community and adoption rate.</p>
